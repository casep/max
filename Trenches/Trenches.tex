\begin{abstract}
The objective of this paper is to present the author's reflections on the question: ``The worst aspect of life in the trenches was boredom''.

\end{abstract}

\section{Main part}

While it is true that boredom was a really important aspect of the life in the trenches, most of the days the soldiers weren't even into battle or doing anything interesting, I don't really agree with this statement.\\

Let me explain why, boredom was a really bad thing but even though you were only some days in the trenches fighting really bad things could happen there (gas attacks,shrapnel from bombs, trench foot, lice, rats). \\

Those, in my opinion, are far worse than boredom, some may kill you painfully and slowly or you could even watch your friends die. 
What about the food? Rats would contaminate it or eat it, the food rations were good but everything could go wrong with some rats, and a lot of people were in constant fear due to this. \\

In conclusion, I don't agree with this statement due to there being many more aspects of life which are worse and more frightening, boredom wonâ€™t kill you but gas attacks and shrapnel will.
